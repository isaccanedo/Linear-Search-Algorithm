* Demonstrates how a [linear search algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-search/) works
* The search algorithm starts from the leftmost of the array and then compare the value to be searched to each elements in the array
* If there is no match, it should return -1. Otherwise, return the index of that array
* Created to simply practice coding in Java
